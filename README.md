# Visualization of Common Sorting Algorithms

### Overview

Common sorting algorithms will be created and visualized on a website to help understand how each sort function works and how the data is managed. It is also satisfying to watch. This project will cover sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, and much more.

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- More to come!

### TO-DO
- Implement more sorts
- Clean up UI
- Construct a better way to display array visually
- Implement step-by-step processes with explanations
